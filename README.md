# My Certificates

This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing the certificates I have earned from various online courses, workshops, and IT events. The certificates are grouped into folders for easier navigation, so you can quickly find achievements in areas like Data Science and IT festivals.  

The goal of this repository is to showcase my continuous learning and progress in different technical fields.
